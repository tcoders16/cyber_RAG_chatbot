Version 1.1 of this Cybersecurity Framework refines, clarifies, and enhances Version 1.0, which 
was issued in February 2014. It incorporates comments received on the two drafts of Version 1.1. 
Version 1.1 is intended to be implemented by first-time and current Framework users. Current 
users should be able to implement Version 1.1 with minimal or no disruption; compatibility with 
Version 1.0 has been an explicit objective. 
The following table summarizes the changes made between Version 1.0 and Version 1.1. 
Table NTR-1 - Summary of changes between Framework Version 1.0 and Version 1.1. 
Update Description of Update 
Clarified that terms like 
“compliance” can be 
confusing and mean 
something very different 
to various Framework 
stakeholders 
Added clarity that the Framework has utility as a structure and 
language for organizing and expressing compliance with an 
organization’s own cybersecurity requirements.  However, the 
variety of ways in which the Framework can be used by an 
organization means that phrases like “compliance with the 
Framework” can be confusing. 
A new section on self-
assessment 
Added Section 4.0 Self-Assessing Cybersecurity Risk with the 
Framework to explain how the Framework can be used by 
organizations to understand and assess their cybersecurity risk, 
including the use of measurements. 
Greatly expanded 
explanation of using 
Framework for Cyber 
Supply Chain Risk 
Management purposes 
An expanded Section 3.3 Communicating Cybersecurity 
Requirements with Stakeholders helps users better understand 
Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM), while a new 
Section 3.4 Buying Decisions highlights use of the Framework 
in understanding risk associated with commercial off-the-shelf 
products and services. Additional Cyber SCRM criteria were 
added to the Implementation Tiers. Finally, a Supply Chain Risk 
Management Category, including multiple Subcategories, has 
been added to the Framework Core. 
Refinements to better 
account for authentication, 
authorization, and identity 
proofing 
The language of the Access Control Category has been refined 
to better account for authentication, authorization, and identity 
proofing. This included adding one Subcategory each for 
Authentication and Identity Proofing. Also, the Category has 
been renamed to Identity Management and Access Control 
(PR.AC) to better represent the scope of the Category and 
corresponding Subcategories. 
Better explanation of the 
relationship between 
Implementation Tiers and 
Profiles 
Added language to Section 3.2 Establishing or Improving a 
Cybersecurity Program on using Framework Tiers in 
Framework implementation. Added language to Framework 
Tiers to reflect integration of Framework considerations within 
organizational risk management programs. The Framework Tier 
concepts were also refined. Updated Figure 2.0 to include 
actions from the Framework Tiers.

Consideration of 
Coordinated Vulnerability 
Disclosure 
A Subcategory related to the vulnerability disclosure lifecycle 
was added. 
 
As with Version 1.0, Version 1.1 users are encouraged to customize the Framework to maximize 
individual organizational value.

Ac kn o wl e d g e m e n t s 
This publication is the result of an ongoing collaborative effort involving industry, academia, and 
government. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) launched the project by 
convening private- and public-sector organizations and individuals in 2013. Published in 2014 
and revised during 2017 and 2018, this Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure 
Cybersecurity has relied upon eight public workshops, multiple Requests for Comment or 
Information, and thousands of direct interactions with stakeholders from across all sectors of the 
United States along with many sectors from around the world. 
 
The impetus to change Version 1.0 and the changes that appear in this Version 1.1 were based 
on: 
 Feedback and frequently asked questions to NIST since release of Framework Version 
1.0; 
 105 responses to the December 2015 request for information (RFI), Views on the 
Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity; 
 Over 85 comments on a December 5, 2017 proposed second draft of Version 1.1; 
 Over 120 comments on a January 10, 2017, proposed first draft Version 1.1; and 
 Input from over 1,200 attendees at the 2016 and 2017 Framework workshops. 
In addition, NIST previously released Version 1.0 of the Cybersecurity Framework with a 
companion document, NIST Roadmap for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity. This 
Roadmap highlighted key “areas of improvement” for further development, alignment, and 
collaboration.  Through private and public-sector efforts, some areas of improvement have 
advanced enough to be included in this Framework Version 1.1. 
 
NIST acknowledges and thanks all of those who have contributed to this Framework.

The United States depends on the reliable functioning of critical infrastructure. Cybersecurity 
threats exploit the increased complexity and connectivity of critical infrastructure systems, 
placing the Nation’s security, economy, and public safety and health at risk. Similar to financial 
and reputational risks, cybersecurity risk affects a company’s bottom line. It can drive up costs 
and affect revenue. It can harm an organization’s ability to innovate and to gain and maintain 
customers. Cybersecurity can be an important and amplifying component of an organization’s 
overall risk management.  
To better address these risks, the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014
1
 (CEA) updated the 
role of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to include identifying and 
developing cybersecurity risk frameworks for voluntary use by critical infrastructure owners and 
operators. Through CEA, NIST must identify “a prioritized, flexible, repeatable, performance-
based, and cost-effective approach, including information security measures and controls that 
may be voluntarily adopted by owners and operators of critical infrastructure to help them 
identify, assess, and manage cyber risks.” This formalized NIST’s previous work developing 
Framework Version 1.0 under Executive Order (EO) 13636, “Improving Critical Infrastructure 
Cybersecurity” (February 2013), and provided guidance for future Framework evolution. The 
Framework that was developed under EO 13636, and continues to evolve according to CEA, 
uses a common language to address and manage cybersecurity risk in a cost-effective way based 
on business and organizational needs without placing additional regulatory requirements on 
businesses. 
The Framework focuses on using business drivers to guide cybersecurity activities and 
considering cybersecurity risks as part of the organization’s risk management processes. The 
Framework consists of three parts: the Framework Core, the Implementation Tiers, and the 
Framework Profiles. The Framework Core is a set of cybersecurity activities, outcomes, and 
informative references that are common across sectors and critical infrastructure. Elements of the 
Core provide detailed guidance for developing individual organizational Profiles. Through use of 
Profiles, the Framework will help an organization to align and prioritize its cybersecurity 
activities with its business/mission requirements, risk tolerances, and resources. The Tiers 
provide a mechanism for organizations to view and understand the characteristics of their 
approach to managing cybersecurity risk, which will help in prioritizing and achieving 
cybersecurity objectives. 
While this document was developed to improve cybersecurity risk management in critical 
infrastructure, the Framework can be used by organizations in any sector or community. The 
Framework enables organizations – regardless of size, degree of cybersecurity risk, or 
cybersecurity sophistication – to apply the principles and best practices of risk management to 
improving security and resilience. 
The Framework provides a common organizing structure for multiple approaches to 
cybersecurity by assembling standards, guidelines, and practices that are working effectively 
today. Moreover, because it references globally recognized standards for cybersecurity, the

Framework can serve as a model for international cooperation on strengthening cybersecurity in 
critical infrastructure as well as other sectors and communities. 
The Framework offers a flexible way to address cybersecurity, including cybersecurity’s effect 
on physical, cyber, and people dimensions. It is applicable to organizations relying on 
technology, whether their cybersecurity focus is primarily on information technology (IT), 
industrial control systems (ICS), cyber-physical systems (CPS), or connected devices more 
generally, including the Internet of Things (IoT). The Framework can assist organizations in 
addressing cybersecurity as it affects the privacy of customers, employees, and other parties. 
Additionally, the Framework’s outcomes serve as targets for workforce development and 
evolution activities. 
The Framework is not a one-size-fits-all approach to managing cybersecurity risk for critical 
infrastructure. Organizations will continue to have unique risks – different threats, different 
vulnerabilities, different risk tolerances. They also will vary in how they customize practices 
described in the Framework. Organizations can determine activities that are important to critical 
service delivery and can prioritize investments to maximize the impact of each dollar spent. 
Ultimately, the Framework is aimed at reducing and better managing cybersecurity risks. 
To account for the unique cybersecurity needs of organizations, there are a wide variety of ways 
to use the Framework. The decision about how to apply it is left to the implementing 
organization. For example, one organization may choose to use the Framework Implementation 
Tiers to articulate envisioned risk management practices. Another organization may use the 
Framework’s five Functions to analyze its entire risk management portfolio; that analysis may or 
may not rely on more detailed companion guidance, such as controls catalogs. There sometimes 
is discussion about “compliance” with the Framework, and the Framework has utility as a 
structure and language for organizing and expressing compliance with an organization’s own 
cybersecurity requirements. Nevertheless, the variety of ways in which the Framework can be 
used by an organization means that phrases like “compliance with the Framework” can be 
confusing and mean something very different to various stakeholders. 
The Framework is a living document and will continue to be updated and improved as industry 
provides feedback on implementation. NIST will continue coordinating with the private sector 
and government agencies at all levels. As the Framework is put into greater practice, additional 
lessons learned will be integrated into future versions. This will ensure the Framework is 
meeting the needs of critical infrastructure owners and operators in a dynamic and challenging 
environment of new threats, risks, and solutions. 
Expanded and more effective use and sharing of best practices of this voluntary Framework are 
the next steps to improve the cybersecurity of our Nation’s critical infrastructure – providing 
evolving guidance for individual organizations while increasing the cybersecurity posture of the 
Nation’s critical infrastructure and the broader economy and society.

The United States depends on the reliable functioning of its critical infrastructure. Cybersecurity 
threats exploit the increased complexity and connectivity of critical infrastructure systems, 
placing the Nation’s security, economy, and public safety and health at risk. Similar to financial 
and reputational risks, cybersecurity risk affects a company’s bottom line. It can drive up costs 
and affect revenue. It can harm an organization’s ability to innovate and to gain and maintain 
customers. Cybersecurity can be an important and amplifying component of an organization’s 
overall risk management.  
To strengthen the resilience of this infrastructure, the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014
2
 
(CEA) updated the role of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to 
“facilitate and support the development of” cybersecurity risk frameworks. Through CEA, NIST 
must identify “a prioritized, flexible, repeatable, performance-based, and cost-effective approach, 
including information security measures and controls that may be voluntarily adopted by owners 
and operators of critical infrastructure to help them identify, assess, and manage cyber risks.” 
This formalized NIST’s previous work developing Framework Version 1.0 under Executive 
Order 13636, “Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity,” issued in February 2013
3
, and 
provided guidance for future Framework evolution. 
Critical infrastructure
4
 is defined in the U.S. Patriot Act of 2001
5
 as “systems and assets, whether 
physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems 
and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national 
public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.” Due to the increasing pressures 
from external and internal threats, organizations responsible for critical infrastructure need to 
have a consistent and iterative approach to identifying, assessing, and managing cybersecurity 
risk. This approach is necessary regardless of an organization’s size, threat exposure, or 
cybersecurity sophistication today.  
The critical infrastructure community includes public and private owners and operators, and 
other entities with a role in securing the Nation’s infrastructure. Members of each critical 
infrastructure sector perform functions that are supported by the broad category of technology, 
including information technology (IT), industrial control systems (ICS), cyber-physical systems 
(CPS), and connected devices more generally, including the Internet of Things (IoT). This 
reliance on technology, communication, and interconnectivity has changed and expanded the 
potential vulnerabilities and increased potential risk to operations. For example, as technology 
and the data it produces and processes are increasingly used to deliver critical services and 
support business/mission decisions, the potential impacts of a cybersecurity incident on an

organization, the health and safety of individuals, the environment, communities, and the broader 
economy and society should be considered.  
To manage cybersecurity risks, a clear understanding of the organization’s business drivers and 
security considerations specific to its use of technology is required. Because each organization’s 
risks, priorities, and systems are unique, the tools and methods used to achieve the outcomes 
described by the Framework will vary. 
Recognizing the role that the protection of privacy and civil liberties plays in creating greater 
public trust, the Framework includes a methodology to protect individual privacy and civil 
liberties when critical infrastructure organizations conduct cybersecurity activities. Many 
organizations already have processes for addressing privacy and civil liberties. The methodology 
is designed to complement such processes and provide guidance to facilitate privacy risk 
management consistent with an organization’s approach to cybersecurity risk management. 
Integrating privacy and cybersecurity can benefit organizations by increasing customer 
confidence, enabling more standardized sharing of information, and simplifying operations 
across legal regimes. 
The Framework remains effective and supports technical innovation because it is technology 
neutral, while also referencing a variety of existing standards, guidelines, and practices that 
evolve with technology. By relying on those global standards, guidelines, and practices 
developed, managed, and updated by industry, the tools and methods available to achieve the 
Framework outcomes will scale across borders, acknowledge the global nature of cybersecurity 
risks, and evolve with technological advances and business requirements. The use of existing and 
emerging standards will enable economies of scale and drive the development of effective 
products, services, and practices that meet identified market needs. Market competition also 
promotes faster diffusion of these technologies and practices and realization of many benefits by 
the stakeholders in these sectors. 
Building from those standards, guidelines, and practices, the Framework provides a common 
taxonomy and mechanism for organizations to: 
1) Describe their current cybersecurity posture; 
2) Describe their target state for cybersecurity; 
3) Identify and prioritize opportunities for improvement within the context of a 
continuous and repeatable process; 
4) Assess progress toward the target state; 
5) Communicate among internal and external stakeholders about cybersecurity risk. 
The Framework is not a one-size-fits-all approach to managing cybersecurity risk for critical 
infrastructure. Organizations will continue to have unique risks – different threats, different 
vulnerabilities, different risk tolerances. They also will vary in how they customize practices 
described in the Framework. Organizations can determine activities that are important to critical 
service delivery and can prioritize investments to maximize the impact of each dollar spent. 
Ultimately, the Framework is aimed at reducing and better managing cybersecurity risks.

To account for the unique cybersecurity needs of organizations, there are a wide variety of ways 
to use the Framework. The decision about how to apply it is left to the implementing 
organization. For example, one organization may choose to use the Framework Implementation 
Tiers to articulate envisioned risk management practices. Another organization may use the 
Framework’s five Functions to analyze its entire risk management portfolio; that analysis may or 
may not rely on more detailed companion guidance, such as controls catalogs. There sometimes 
is discussion about “compliance” with the Framework, and the Framework has utility as a 
structure and language for organizing and expressing compliance with an organization’s own 
cybersecurity requirements. Nevertheless, the variety of ways in which the Framework can be 
used by an organization means that phrases like “compliance with the Framework” can be 
confusing and mean something very different to various stakeholders. 
The Framework complements, and does not replace, an organization’s risk management process 
and cybersecurity program. The organization can use its current processes and leverage the 
Framework to identify opportunities to strengthen and communicate its management of 
cybersecurity risk while aligning with industry practices. Alternatively, an organization without 
an existing cybersecurity program can use the Framework as a reference to establish one. 
While the Framework has been developed to improve cybersecurity risk management as it relates 
to critical infrastructure, it can be used by organizations in any sector of the economy or society. 
It is intended to be useful to companies, government agencies, and not-for-profit organizations 
regardless of their focus or size. The common taxonomy of standards, guidelines, and practices 
that it provides also is not country-specific. Organizations outside the United States may also use 
the Framework to strengthen their own cybersecurity efforts, and the Framework can contribute 
to developing a common language for international cooperation on critical infrastructure 
cybersecurity. 
1 . 1 O v e r v i e w   o f   t h e   F r a m e w o r k 
The Framework is a risk-based approach to managing cybersecurity risk, and is composed of 
three parts: the Framework Core, the Framework Implementation Tiers, and the Framework 
Profiles. Each Framework component reinforces the connection between business/mission 
drivers and cybersecurity activities. These components are explained below. 
 The Framework Core is a set of cybersecurity activities, desired outcomes, and 
applicable references that are common across critical infrastructure sectors. The Core 
presents industry standards, guidelines, and practices in a manner that allows for 
communication of cybersecurity activities and outcomes across the organization from the 
executive level to the implementation/operations level. The Framework Core consists of 
five concurrent and continuous Functions—Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover. 
When considered together, these Functions provide a high-level, strategic view of the 
lifecycle of an organization’s management of cybersecurity risk. The Framework Core 
then identifies underlying key Categories and Subcategories – which are discrete 
outcomes – for each Function, and matches them with example Informative References 
such as existing standards, guidelines, and practices for each Subcategory. 
 Framework Implementation Tiers (“Tiers”) provide context on how an organization 
views cybersecurity risk and the processes in place to manage that risk. Tiers describe the 
degree to which an organization’s cybersecurity risk management practices exhibit the 

April 16, 2018  Cybersecurity Framework Version 1.1

4 
characteristics defined in the Framework (e.g., risk and threat aware, repeatable, and 
adaptive). The Tiers characterize an organization’s practices over a range, from Partial 
(Tier 1) to Adaptive (Tier 4). These Tiers reflect a progression from informal, reactive 
responses to approaches that are agile and risk-informed. During the Tier selection 
process, an organization should consider its current risk management practices, threat 
environment, legal and regulatory requirements, business/mission objectives, and 
organizational constraints. 
 A Framework Profile (“Profile”) represents the outcomes based on business needs that an 
organization has selected from the Framework Categories and Subcategories. The Profile 
can be characterized as the alignment of standards, guidelines, and practices to the 
Framework Core in a particular implementation scenario. Profiles can be used to identify 
opportunities for improving cybersecurity posture by comparing a “Current” Profile (the 
“as is” state) with a “Target” Profile (the “to be” state). To develop a Profile, an 
organization can review all of the Categories and Subcategories and, based on 
business/mission drivers and a risk assessment, determine which are most important; it 
can add Categories and Subcategories as needed to address the organization’s risks. The 
Current Profile can then be used to support prioritization and measurement of progress 
toward the Target Profile, while factoring in other business needs including cost-
effectiveness and innovation. Profiles can be used to conduct self-assessments and 
communicate within an organization or between organizations. 
1.2 R i s k   M a n a g e m e n t   a n d   t h e   C y b e r s e c u r i t y   F r a m e w o r k 
Risk management is the ongoing process of identifying, assessing, and responding to risk. To 
manage risk, organizations should understand the likelihood that an event will occur and the 
potential resulting impacts. With this information, organizations can determine the acceptable 
level of risk for achieving their organizational objectives and can express this as their risk 
tolerance.  
With an understanding of risk tolerance, organizations can prioritize cybersecurity activities, 
enabling organizations to make informed decisions about cybersecurity expenditures. 
Implementation of risk management programs offers organizations the ability to quantify and 
communicate adjustments to their cybersecurity programs. Organizations may choose to handle 
risk in different ways, including mitigating the risk, transferring the risk, avoiding the risk, or 
accepting the risk, depending on the potential impact to the delivery of critical services. The 
Framework uses risk management processes to enable organizations to inform and prioritize 
decisions regarding cybersecurity. It supports recurring risk assessments and validation of 
business drivers to help organizations select target states for cybersecurity activities that reflect 
desired outcomes. Thus, the Framework gives organizations the ability to dynamically select and 
direct improvement in cybersecurity risk management for the IT and ICS environments. 
The Framework is adaptive to provide a flexible and risk-based implementation that can be used 
with a broad array of cybersecurity risk management processes. Examples of cybersecurity risk 
management processes include International Organization for Standardization (ISO)

The Framework provides a common language for understanding, managing, and expressing 
cybersecurity risk to internal and external stakeholders. It can be used to help identify and 
prioritize actions for reducing cybersecurity risk, and it is a tool for aligning policy, business, and 
technological approaches to managing that risk. It can be used to manage cybersecurity risk 
across entire organizations or it can be focused on the delivery of critical services within an 
organization. Different types of entities – including sector coordinating structures, associations, 
and organizations – can use the Framework for different purposes, including the creation of 
common Profiles. 
2 . 1 F r a m e w o r k   C o r e 
The Framework Core provides a set of activities to achieve specific cybersecurity outcomes, and 
references examples of guidance to achieve those outcomes. The Core is not a checklist of 
actions to perform. It presents key cybersecurity outcomes identified by stakeholders as helpful 
in managing cybersecurity risk. The Core comprises four elements: Functions, Categories, 
Subcategories, and Informative References, depicted in Figure 1: 
 
Figure 1: Framework Core Structure 
The Framework Core elements work together as follows: 
 Functions organize basic cybersecurity activities at their highest level. These Functions 
are Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. They aid an organization in 
expressing its management of cybersecurity risk by organizing information, enabling risk 
management decisions, addressing threats, and improving by learning from previous 
activities. The Functions also align with existing methodologies for incident management 
and help show the impact of investments in cybersecurity. For example, investments in 
planning and exercises support timely response and recovery actions, resulting in reduced

 Categories are the subdivisions of a Function into groups of cybersecurity outcomes 
closely tied to programmatic needs and particular activities. Examples of Categories 
include “Asset Management,” “Identity Management and Access Control,” and 
“Detection Processes.”  
 Subcategories further divide a Category into specific outcomes of technical and/or 
management activities. They provide a set of results that, while not exhaustive, help 
support achievement of the outcomes in each Category. Examples of Subcategories 
include “External information systems are catalogued,” “Data-at-rest is protected,” and 
“Notifications from detection systems are investigated.”  
 Informative References are specific sections of standards, guidelines, and practices 
common among critical infrastructure sectors that illustrate a method to achieve the 
outcomes associated with each Subcategory. The Informative References presented in the 
Framework Core are illustrative and not exhaustive. They are based upon cross-sector 
guidance most frequently referenced during the Framework development process. 
The five Framework Core Functions are defined below. These Functions are not intended to 
form a serial path or lead to a static desired end state. Rather, the Functions should be performed 
concurrently and continuously to form an operational culture that addresses the dynamic 
cybersecurity risk. See Appendix A for the complete Framework Core listing. 
 Identify – Develop an organizational understanding to manage cybersecurity risk to 
systems, people, assets, data, and capabilities. 
The activities in the Identify Function are foundational for effective use of the 
Framework. Understanding the business context, the resources that support critical 
functions, and the related cybersecurity risks enables an organization to focus and 
prioritize its efforts, consistent with its risk management strategy and business needs. 
Examples of outcome Categories within this Function include: Asset Management; 
Business Environment; Governance; Risk Assessment; and Risk Management Strategy. 
 Protect – Develop and implement appropriate safeguards to ensure delivery of critical 
services. 
The Protect Function supports the ability to limit or contain the impact of a potential 
cybersecurity event. Examples of outcome Categories within this Function include: 
Identity Management and Access Control; Awareness and Training; Data Security; 
Information Protection Processes and Procedures; Maintenance; and Protective 
Technology. 
 Detect – Develop and implement appropriate activities to identify the occurrence of a 
cybersecurity event. 
The Detect Function enables timely discovery of cybersecurity events. Examples of 
outcome Categories within this Function include: Anomalies and Events; Security 
Continuous Monitoring; and Detection Processes.

 Respond – Develop and implement appropriate activities to take action regarding a 
detected cybersecurity incident. 
The Respond Function supports the ability to contain the impact of a potential 
cybersecurity incident. Examples of outcome Categories within this Function include: 
Response Planning; Communications; Analysis; Mitigation; and Improvements. 
 Recover – Develop and implement appropriate activities to maintain plans for resilience 
and to restore any capabilities or services that were impaired due to a cybersecurity 
incident. 
The Recover Function supports timely recovery to normal operations to reduce the 
impact from a cybersecurity incident. Examples of outcome Categories within this 
Function include: Recovery Planning; Improvements; and Communications.

The Framework Implementation Tiers (“Tiers”) provide context on how an organization views 
cybersecurity risk and the processes in place to manage that risk. Ranging from Partial (Tier 1) to 
Adaptive (Tier 4), Tiers describe an increasing degree of rigor and sophistication in 
cybersecurity risk management practices. They help determine the extent to which cybersecurity 
risk management is informed by business needs and is integrated into an organization’s overall 
risk management practices. Risk management considerations include many aspects of 
cybersecurity, including the degree to which privacy and civil liberties considerations are 
integrated into an organization’s management of cybersecurity risk and potential risk responses. 
The Tier selection process considers an organization’s current risk management practices, threat 
environment, legal and regulatory requirements, information sharing practices, business/mission 
objectives, supply chain cybersecurity requirements, and organizational constraints. 
Organizations should determine the desired Tier, ensuring that the selected level meets the 
organizational goals, is feasible to implement, and reduces cybersecurity risk to critical assets 
and resources to levels acceptable to the organization. Organizations should consider leveraging 
external guidance obtained from Federal government departments and agencies, Information 
Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs), Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations 
(ISAOs), existing maturity models, or other sources to assist in determining their desired tier.  
While organizations identified as Tier 1 (Partial) are encouraged to consider moving toward Tier 
2 or greater, Tiers do not represent maturity levels. Tiers are meant to support organizational 
decision making about how to manage cybersecurity risk, as well as which dimensions of the 
organization are higher priority and could receive additional resources. Progression to higher 
Tiers is encouraged when a cost-benefit analysis indicates a feasible and cost-effective reduction 
of cybersecurity risk.

Successful implementation of the Framework is based upon achieving the outcomes described in 
the organization’s Target Profile(s) and not upon Tier determination. Still, Tier selection and 
designation naturally affect Framework Profiles. The Tier recommendation by Business/Process 
Level managers, as approved by the Senior Executive Level, will help set the overall tone for 
how cybersecurity risk will be managed within the organization, and should influence 
prioritization within a Target Profile and assessments of progress in addressing gaps. 
The Tier definitions are as follows: 
Tier 1: Partial  
 Risk Management Process – Organizational cybersecurity risk management practices are 
not formalized, and risk is managed in an ad hoc and sometimes reactive manner. 
Prioritization of cybersecurity activities may not be directly informed by organizational 
risk objectives, the threat environment, or business/mission requirements.  
 Integrated Risk Management Program – There is limited awareness of cybersecurity risk 
at the organizational level. The organization implements cybersecurity risk management 
on an irregular, case-by-case basis due to varied experience or information gained from 
outside sources. The organization may not have processes that enable cybersecurity 
information to be shared within the organization. 
 External Participation – The organization does not understand its role in the larger 
ecosystem with respect to either its dependencies or dependents. The organization does 
not collaborate with or receive information (e.g., threat intelligence, best practices, 
technologies) from other entities (e.g., buyers, suppliers, dependencies, dependents, 
ISAOs, researchers, governments), nor does it share information. The organization is 
generally unaware of the cyber supply chain risks of the products and services it provides 
and that it uses.  
Tier 2: Risk Informed  
 Risk Management Process – Risk management practices are approved by management 
but may not be established as organizational-wide policy. Prioritization of cybersecurity 
activities and protection needs is directly informed by organizational risk objectives, the 
threat environment, or business/mission requirements. 
 Integrated Risk Management Program – There is an awareness of cybersecurity risk at 
the organizational level, but an organization-wide approach to managing cybersecurity 
risk has not been established. Cybersecurity information is shared within the organization 
on an informal basis. Consideration of cybersecurity in organizational objectives and 
programs may occur at some but not all levels of the organization. Cyber risk assessment 
of organizational and external assets occurs, but is not typically repeatable or reoccurring. 
 External Participation – Generally, the organization understands its role in the larger 
ecosystem with respect to either its own dependencies or dependents, but not both. The 
organization collaborates with and receives some information from other entities and 
generates some of its own information, but may not share information with others. 
Additionally, the organization is aware of the cyber supply chain risks associated with 
the products and services it provides and uses, but does not act consistently or formally 
upon those risks.  

April 16, 2018  Cybersecurity Framework Version 1.1 
This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.CSWP.04162018  
10 
Tier 3: Repeatable  
 Risk Management Process – The organization’s risk management practices are formally 
approved and expressed as policy. Organizational cybersecurity practices are regularly 
updated based on the application of risk management processes to changes in 
business/mission requirements and a changing threat and technology landscape. 
 Integrated Risk Management Program – There is an organization-wide approach to 
manage cybersecurity risk. Risk-informed policies, processes, and procedures are 
defined, implemented as intended, and reviewed. Consistent methods are in place to 
respond effectively to changes in risk. Personnel possess the knowledge and skills to 
perform their appointed roles and responsibilities. The organization consistently and 
accurately monitors cybersecurity risk of organizational assets. Senior cybersecurity and 
non-cybersecurity executives communicate regularly regarding cybersecurity risk.  
Senior executives ensure consideration of cybersecurity through all lines of operation in 
the organization. 
 External Participation - The organization understands its role, dependencies, and 
dependents in the larger ecosystem and may contribute to the community’s broader 
understanding of risks. It collaborates with and receives information from other entities 
regularly that complements internally generated information, and shares information 
with other entities. The organization is aware of the cyber supply chain risks associated 
with the products and services it provides and that it uses. Additionally, it usually acts 
formally upon those risks, including mechanisms such as written agreements to 
communicate baseline requirements, governance structures (e.g., risk councils), and 
policy implementation and monitoring.  
Tier 4: Adaptive  
 Risk Management Process – The organization adapts its cybersecurity practices based on 
previous and current cybersecurity activities, including lessons learned and predictive 
indicators. Through a process of continuous improvement incorporating advanced 
cybersecurity technologies and practices, the organization actively adapts to a changing 
threat and technology landscape and responds in a timely and effective manner to 
evolving, sophisticated threats.  
 Integrated Risk Management Program – There is an organization-wide approach to 
managing cybersecurity risk that uses risk-informed policies, processes, and procedures 
to address potential cybersecurity events. The relationship between cybersecurity risk and 
organizational objectives is clearly understood and considered when making decisions. 
Senior executives monitor cybersecurity risk in the same context as financial risk and 
other organizational risks. The organizational budget is based on an understanding of the 
current and predicted risk environment and risk tolerance. Business units implement 
executive vision and analyze system-level risks in the context of the organizational risk 
tolerances. Cybersecurity risk management is part of the organizational culture and 
evolves from an awareness of previous activities and continuous awareness of activities 
on their systems and networks. The organization can quickly and efficiently account for 
changes to business/mission objectives in how risk is approached and communicated.

11 
 External Participation - The organization understands its role, dependencies, and 
dependents in the larger ecosystem and contributes to the community’s broader 
understanding of risks. It receives, generates, and reviews prioritized information that 
informs continuous analysis of its risks as the threat and technology landscapes evolve. 
The organization shares that information internally and externally with other 
collaborators. The organization uses real-time or near real-time information to understand 
and consistently act upon cyber supply chain risks associated with the products and 
services it provides and that it uses. Additionally, it communicates proactively, using 
formal (e.g. agreements) and informal mechanisms to develop and maintain strong supply 
chain relationships. 
2 . 3 F r a m e w o r k   P r o f i l e 
The Framework Profile (“Profile”) is the alignment of the Functions, Categories, and 
Subcategories with the business requirements, risk tolerance, and resources of the organization. 
A Profile enables organizations to establish a roadmap for reducing cybersecurity risk that is well 
aligned with organizational and sector goals, considers legal/regulatory requirements and 
industry best practices, and reflects risk management priorities. Given the complexity of many 
organizations, they may choose to have multiple profiles, aligned with particular components and 
recognizing their individual needs. 
Framework Profiles can be used to describe the current state or the desired target state of specific 
cybersecurity activities. The Current Profile indicates the cybersecurity outcomes that are 
currently being achieved. The Target Profile indicates the outcomes needed to achieve the 
desired cybersecurity risk management goals. Profiles support business/mission requirements 
and aid in communicating risk within and between organizations. This Framework does not 
prescribe Profile templates, allowing for flexibility in implementation. 
Comparison of Profiles (e.g., the Current Profile and Target Profile) may reveal gaps to be 
addressed to meet cybersecurity risk management objectives. An action plan to address these 
gaps to fulfill a given Category or Subcategory can contribute to the roadmap described above. 
Prioritizing the mitigation of gaps is driven by the organization’s business needs and risk 
management processes. This risk-based approach enables an organization to gauge the resources 
needed (e.g., staffing, funding) to achieve cybersecurity goals in a cost-effective, prioritized 
manner. Furthermore, the Framework is a risk-based approach where the applicability and 
fulfillment of a given Subcategory is subject to the Profile’s scope.

Figure 2 describes a common flow of information and decisions at the following levels within an 
organization: 
 Executive 
 Business/Process 
 Implementation/Operations 
The executive level communicates the mission priorities, available resources, and overall risk 
tolerance to the business/process level. The business/process level uses the information as inputs 
into the risk management process, and then collaborates with the implementation/operations 
level to communicate business needs and create a Profile. The implementation/operations level 
communicates the Profile implementation progress to the business/process level. The 
business/process level uses this information to perform an impact assessment. Business/process 
level management reports the outcomes of that impact assessment to the executive level to 
inform the organization’s overall risk management process and to the implementation/operations 
level for awareness of business impact.

3. 0 Ho w  t o   U s e   t h e   F r a m e wo r k 
An organization can use the Framework as a key part of its systematic process for identifying, 
assessing, and managing cybersecurity risk. The Framework is not designed to replace existing 
processes; an organization can use its current process and overlay it onto the Framework to 
determine gaps in its current cybersecurity risk approach and develop a roadmap to 
improvement. Using the Framework as a cybersecurity risk management tool, an organization 
can determine activities that are most important to critical service delivery and prioritize 
expenditures to maximize the impact of the investment.  
The Framework is designed to complement existing business and cybersecurity operations. It can 
serve as the foundation for a new cybersecurity program or a mechanism for improving an 
existing program. The Framework provides a means of expressing cybersecurity requirements to 
business partners and customers and can help identify gaps in an organization’s cybersecurity 
practices. It also provides a general set of considerations and processes for considering privacy 
and civil liberties implications in the context of a cybersecurity program. 
The Framework can be applied throughout the life cycle phases of plan, design, build/buy, 
deploy, operate, and decommission. The plan phase begins the cycle of any system and lays the 
groundwork for everything that follows. Overarching cybersecurity considerations should be 
declared and described as clearly as possible. The plan should recognize that those 
considerations and requirements are likely to evolve during the remainder of the life cycle. The 
design phase should account for cybersecurity requirements as a part of a larger multi-
disciplinary systems engineering process.
10
 A key milestone of the design phase is validation that 
the system cybersecurity specifications match the needs and risk disposition of the organization 
as captured in a Framework Profile. The desired cybersecurity outcomes prioritized in a Target 
Profile should be incorporated when a) developing the system during the build phase and b) 
purchasing or outsourcing the system during the buy phase. That same Target Profile serves as a 
list of system cybersecurity features that should be assessed when deploying the system to verify 
all features are implemented. The cybersecurity outcomes determined by using the Framework 
then should serve as a basis for ongoing operation of the system. This includes occasional 
reassessment, capturing results in a Current Profile, to verify that cybersecurity requirements are 
still fulfilled. Typically, a complex web of dependencies (e.g., compensating and common 
controls) among systems means the outcomes documented in Target Profiles of related systems 
should be carefully considered as systems are decommissioned. 
The following sections present different ways in which organizations can use the Framework. 
3 . 1 B a s i c   R e v i e w   o f   C y b e r s e c u r i t y   P r a c t i c e s 
The Framework can be used to compare an organization’s current cybersecurity activities with 
those outlined in the Framework Core. Through the creation of a Current Profile, organizations 
can examine the extent to which they are achieving the outcomes described in the Core 
Categories and Subcategories, aligned with the five high-level Functions: Identify, Protect, 
Detect, Respond, and Recover. An organization may find that it is already achieving the desired

outcomes, thus managing cybersecurity commensurate with the known risk. Alternatively, an 
organization may determine that it has opportunities to (or needs to) improve. The organization 
can use that information to develop an action plan to strengthen existing cybersecurity practices 
and reduce cybersecurity risk. An organization may also find that it is overinvesting to achieve 
certain outcomes. The organization can use this information to reprioritize resources. 
While they do not replace a risk management process, these five high-level Functions will 
provide a concise way for senior executives and others to distill the fundamental concepts of 
cybersecurity risk so that they can assess how identified risks are managed, and how their 
organization stacks up at a high level against existing cybersecurity standards, guidelines, and 
practices. The Framework can also help an organization answer fundamental questions, 
including “How are we doing?” Then they can move in a more informed way to strengthen their 
cybersecurity practices where and when deemed necessary.

The following steps illustrate how an organization could use the Framework to create a new 
cybersecurity program or improve an existing program. These steps should be repeated as 
necessary to continuously improve cybersecurity. 
Step 1: Prioritize and Scope. The organization identifies its business/mission objectives and 
high-level organizational priorities. With this information, the organization makes strategic 
decisions regarding cybersecurity implementations and determines the scope of systems and 
assets that support the selected business line or process. The Framework can be adapted to 
support the different business lines or processes within an organization, which may have 
different business needs and associated risk tolerance. Risk tolerances may be reflected in a 
target Implementation Tier. 
Step 2: Orient. Once the scope of the cybersecurity program has been determined for the 
business line or process, the organization identifies related systems and assets, regulatory 
requirements, and overall risk approach. The organization then consults sources to identify 
threats and vulnerabilities applicable to those systems and assets.  
Step 3: Create a Current Profile. The organization develops a Current Profile by indicating 
which Category and Subcategory outcomes from the Framework Core are currently being 
achieved. If an outcome is partially achieved, noting this fact will help support subsequent steps 
by providing baseline information. 
Step 4: Conduct a Risk Assessment. This assessment could be guided by the organization’s 
overall risk management process or previous risk assessment activities. The organization 
analyzes the operational environment in order to discern the likelihood of a cybersecurity event 
and the impact that the event could have on the organization. It is important that organizations 
identify emerging risks and use cyber threat information from internal and external sources to 
gain a better understanding of the likelihood and impact of cybersecurity events. 
Step 5: Create a Target Profile. The organization creates a Target Profile that focuses on the 
assessment of the Framework Categories and Subcategories describing the organization’s desired 
cybersecurity outcomes. Organizations also may develop their own additional Categories and 

April 16, 2018  Cybersecurity Framework Version 1.1

15 
Subcategories to account for unique organizational risks. The organization may also consider 
influences and requirements of external stakeholders such as sector entities, customers, and 
business partners when creating a Target Profile. The Target Profile should appropriately reflect 
criteria within the target Implementation Tier. 
Step 6: Determine, Analyze, and Prioritize Gaps. The organization compares the Current 
Profile and the Target Profile to determine gaps. Next, it creates a prioritized action plan to 
address gaps – reflecting mission drivers, costs and benefits, and risks – to achieve the outcomes 
in the Target Profile. The organization then determines resources, including funding and 
workforce, necessary to address the gaps. Using Profiles in this manner encourages the 
organization to make informed decisions about cybersecurity activities, supports risk 
management, and enables the organization to perform cost-effective, targeted improvements. 
Step 7: Implement Action Plan. The organization determines which actions to take to address 
the gaps, if any, identified in the previous step and then adjusts its current cybersecurity practices 
in order to achieve the Target Profile. For further guidance, the Framework identifies example 
Informative References regarding the Categories and Subcategories, but organizations should 
determine which standards, guidelines, and practices, including those that are sector specific, 
work best for their needs. 
An organization repeats the steps as needed to continuously assess and improve its cybersecurity. 
For instance, organizations may find that more frequent repetition of the orient step improves the 
quality of risk assessments. Furthermore, organizations may monitor progress through iterative 
updates to the Current Profile, subsequently comparing the Current Profile to the Target Profile. 
Organizations may also use this process to align their cybersecurity program with their desired 
Framework Implementation Tier.

The Framework provides a common language to communicate requirements among 
interdependent stakeholders responsible for the delivery of essential critical infrastructure 
products and services. Examples include: 
 An organization may use a Target Profile to express cybersecurity risk management 
requirements to an external service provider (e.g., a cloud provider to which it is 
exporting data). 
 An organization may express its cybersecurity state through a Current Profile to report 
results or to compare with acquisition requirements. 
 A critical infrastructure owner/operator, having identified an external partner on whom 
that infrastructure depends, may use a Target Profile to convey required Categories and 
Subcategories. 
 A critical infrastructure sector may establish a Target Profile that can be used among its 
constituents as an initial baseline Profile to build their tailored Target Profiles. 
 An organization can better manage cybersecurity risk among stakeholders by assessing 
their position in the critical infrastructure and the broader digital economy using 
Implementation Tiers. 
Communication is especially important among stakeholders up and down supply chains. Supply 
chains are complex, globally distributed, and interconnected sets of resources and processes 

April 16, 2018  Cybersecurity Framework Version 1.1

16 
between multiple levels of organizations. Supply chains begin with the sourcing of products and 
services and extend from the design, development, manufacturing, processing, handling, and 
delivery of products and services to the end user. Given these complex and interconnected 
relationships, supply chain risk management (SCRM) is a critical organizational function.
11
 
Cyber SCRM is the set of activities necessary to manage cybersecurity risk associated with 
external parties. More specifically, cyber SCRM addresses both the cybersecurity effect an 
organization has on external parties and the cybersecurity effect external parties have on an 
organization. 
A primary objective of cyber SCRM is to identify, assess, and mitigate “products and services 
that may contain potentially malicious functionality, are counterfeit, or are vulnerable due to 
poor manufacturing and development practices within the cyber supply chain
12
.” Cyber SCRM 
activities may include: 
 Determining cybersecurity requirements for suppliers, 
 Enacting cybersecurity requirements through formal agreement (e.g., contracts), 
 Communicating to suppliers how those cybersecurity requirements will be verified 
and validated, 
 Verifying that cybersecurity requirements are met through a variety of assessment 
methodologies, and 
 Governing and managing the above activities. 
As depicted in Figure 3, cyber SCRM encompasses technology suppliers and buyers, as well as 
non-technology suppliers and buyers, where technology is minimally composed of information 
technology (IT), industrial control systems (ICS), cyber-physical systems (CPS), and connected 
devices more generally, including the Internet of Things (IoT). Figure 3 depicts an organization 
at a single point in time. However, through the normal course of business operations, most 
organizations will be both an upstream supplier and downstream buyer in relation to other 
organizations or end users.

 Communicating Cybersecurity Requirements (Section 3.3) and Buying Decisions (Section 3.4) address only two 
uses of the Framework for cyber SCRM and are not intended to address cyber SCRM comprehensively.

Figure 3: Cyber Supply Chain Relationships 
The parties described in Figure 3 comprise an organization’s cybersecurity ecosystem. These 
relationships highlight the crucial role of cyber SCRM in addressing cybersecurity risk in critical 
infrastructure and the broader digital economy. These relationships, the products and services 
they provide, and the risks they present should be identified and factored into the protective and 
detective capabilities of organizations, as well as their response and recovery protocols. 
In the figure above, “Buyer” refers to the downstream people or organizations that consume a 
given product or service from an organization, including both for-profit and not-for-profit 
organizations. “Supplier” encompasses upstream product and service providers that are used for 
an organization’s internal purposes (e.g., IT infrastructure) or integrated into the products or 
services provided to the Buyer.  These terms are applicable for both technology-based and non-
technology-based products and services. 
Whether considering individual Subcategories of the Core or the comprehensive considerations 
of a Profile, the Framework offers organizations and their partners a method to help ensure the 
new product or service meets critical security outcomes. By first selecting outcomes that are 
relevant to the context (e.g., transmission of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), mission 
critical service delivery, data verification services, product or service integrity) the organization 
then can evaluate partners against those criteria. For example, if a system is being purchased that 
will monitor Operational Technology (OT) for anomalous network communication, availability 
may be a particularly important cybersecurity objective to achieve and should drive a 
Technology Supplier evaluation against applicable Subcategories (e.g., ID.BE-4, ID.SC-3, 
ID.SC-4, ID.SC-5, PR.DS-4, PR.DS-6, PR.DS-7, PR.DS-8, PR.IP-1, DE.AE-5).

3.4 B u y i n g   D e c i s i o n s 
Since a Framework Target Profile is a prioritized list of organizational cybersecurity 
requirements, Target Profiles can be used to inform decisions about buying products and 
services. This transaction varies from Communicating Cybersecurity Requirements with 
Stakeholders (addressed in Section 3.3) in that it may not be possible to impose a set of 
cybersecurity requirements on the supplier. The objective should be to make the best buying 
decision among multiple suppliers, given a carefully determined list of cybersecurity 
requirements. Often, this means some degree of trade-off, comparing multiple products or 
services with known gaps to the Target Profile. 
Once a product or service is purchased, the Profile also can be used to track and address residual 
cybersecurity risk. For example, if the service or product purchased did not meet all the 
objectives described in the Target Profile, the organization can address the residual risk through 
other management actions. The Profile also provides the organization a method for assessing if 
the product meets cybersecurity outcomes through periodic review and testing mechanisms.

R e f e r e n c e s 
The Framework can be used to identify opportunities for new or revised standards, guidelines, or 
practices where additional Informative References would help organizations address emerging 
needs. An organization implementing a given Subcategory, or developing a new Subcategory, 
might discover that there are few Informative References, if any, for a related activity. To 
address that need, the organization might collaborate with technology leaders and/or standards 
bodies to draft, develop, and coordinate standards, guidelines, or practices. 
3.6 M e t h o d o l o g y   t o   P r o t e c t  P r i v a c y   a n d   C i v i l   L i b e r ties 
This section describes a methodology to address individual privacy and civil liberties 
implications that may result from cybersecurity. This methodology is intended to be a general set 
of considerations and processes since privacy and civil liberties implications may differ by sector 
or over time and organizations may address these considerations and processes with a range of 
technical implementations. Nonetheless, not all activities in a cybersecurity program engender 
privacy and civil liberties considerations. Technical privacy standards, guidelines, and additional 
best practices may need to be developed to support improved technical implementations. 
Privacy and cybersecurity have a strong connection. An organization’s cybersecurity activities 
also can create risks to privacy and civil liberties when personal information is used, collected, 
processed, maintained, or disclosed. Some examples include: cybersecurity activities that result 
in the over-collection or over-retention of personal information; disclosure or use of personal 
information unrelated to cybersecurity activities; and cybersecurity mitigation activities that 
result in denial of service or other similar potentially adverse impacts, including some types of 
incident detection or monitoring that may inhibit freedom of expression or association. 
The government and its agents have a responsibility to protect civil liberties arising from 
cybersecurity activities. As referenced in the methodology below, government or its agents that 
own or operate critical infrastructure should have a process in place to support compliance of 
cybersecurity activities with applicable privacy laws, regulations, and Constitutional 
requirements.

To address privacy implications, organizations may consider how their cybersecurity program 
might incorporate privacy principles such as: data minimization in the collection, disclosure, and 
retention of personal information material related to the cybersecurity incident; use limitations 
outside of cybersecurity activities on any information collected specifically for cybersecurity 
activities; transparency for certain cybersecurity activities; individual consent and redress for 
adverse impacts arising from use of personal information in cybersecurity activities; data quality, 
integrity, and security; and accountability and auditing. 
As organizations assess the Framework Core in Appendix A, the following processes and 
activities may be considered as a means to address the above-referenced privacy and civil 
liberties implications: 
Governance of cybersecurity risk 
 An organization’s assessment of cybersecurity risk and potential risk responses considers 
the privacy implications of its cybersecurity program. 
 Individuals with cybersecurity-related privacy responsibilities report to appropriate 
management and are appropriately trained. 
 Process is in place to support compliance of cybersecurity activities with applicable 
privacy laws, regulations, and Constitutional requirements. 
 Process is in place to assess implementation of the above organizational measures and 
controls. 
Approaches to identifying, authenticating, and authorizing individuals to access 
organizational assets and systems 
 Steps are taken to identify and address the privacy implications of identity management 
and access control measures to the extent that they involve collection, disclosure, or use 
of personal information. 
Awareness and training measures 
 Applicable information from organizational privacy policies is included in cybersecurity 
workforce training and awareness activities. 
 Service providers that provide cybersecurity-related services for the organization are 
informed about the organization’s applicable privacy policies. 
Anomalous activity detection and system and assets monitoring 
 Process is in place to conduct a privacy review of an organization’s anomalous activity 
detection and cybersecurity monitoring.  
Response activities, including information sharing or other mitigation efforts 
 Process is in place to assess and address whether, when, how, and the extent to which 
personal information is shared outside the organization as part of cybersecurity 
information sharing activities. 
 Process is in place to conduct a privacy review of an organization’s cybersecurity 
mitigation efforts.

4. 0 S e l f-As s e s s i n g  Cybersecurity Ris k w ith the Fra mewor k 
The Cybersecurity Framework is designed to reduce risk by improving the management of 
cybersecurity risk to organizational objectives. Ideally, organizations using the Framework will 
be able to measure and assign values to their risk along with the cost and benefits of steps taken 
to reduce risk to acceptable levels. The better an organization is able to measure its risk, costs, 
and benefits of cybersecurity strategies and steps, the more rational, effective, and valuable its 
cybersecurity approach and investments will be. 
Over time, self-assessment and measurement should improve decision making about investment 
priorities. For example, measuring – or at least robustly characterizing – aspects of an 
organization’s cybersecurity state and trends over time can enable that organization to 
understand and convey meaningful risk information to dependents, suppliers, buyers, and other 
parties. An organization can accomplish this internally or by seeking a third-party assessment. If 
done properly and with an appreciation of limitations, these measurements can provide a basis 
for strong trusted relationships, both inside and outside of an organization. 
To examine the effectiveness of investments, an organization must first have a clear 
understanding of its organizational objectives, the relationship between those objectives and 
supportive cybersecurity outcomes, and how those discrete cybersecurity outcomes are 
implemented and managed. While measurements of all those items is beyond the scope of the 
Framework, the cybersecurity outcomes of the Framework Core support self-assessment of 
investment effectiveness and cybersecurity activities in the following ways: 
 Making choices about how different portions of the cybersecurity operation should 
influence the selection of Target Implementation Tiers, 
 Evaluating the organization’s approach to cybersecurity risk management by determining 
Current Implementation Tiers, 
 Prioritizing cybersecurity outcomes by developing Target Profiles, 
 Determining the degree to which specific cybersecurity steps achieve desired 
cybersecurity outcomes by assessing Current Profiles, and 
 Measuring the degree of implementation for controls catalogs or technical guidance listed 
as Informative References. 
The development of cybersecurity performance metrics is evolving. Organizations should be 
thoughtful, creative, and careful about the ways in which they employ measurements to optimize 
use, while avoiding reliance on artificial indicators of current state and progress in improving 
cybersecurity risk management. Judging cyber risk requires discipline and should be revisited 
periodically. Any time measurements are employed as part of the Framework process, 
organizations are encouraged to clearly identify and know why these measurements are 
important and how they will contribute to the overall management of cybersecurity risk. They 
also should be clear about the limitations of measurements that are used. 
For example, tracking security measures and business outcomes may provide meaningful insight 
as to how changes in granular security controls affect the completion of organizational 
objectives. Verifying achievement of some organizational objectives requires analyzing the data 
only after that objective was to have been achieved. This type of lagging measure is more

absolute.  However, it is often more valuable to predict whether a cybersecurity risk may occur, 
and the impact it might have, using a leading measure. 
Organizations are encouraged to innovate and customize how they incorporate measurements 
into their application of the Framework with a full appreciation of their usefulness and 
limitations.

This appendix presents the Framework Core: a listing of Functions, Categories, Subcategories, 
and Informative References that describe specific cybersecurity activities that are common 
across all critical infrastructure sectors. The chosen presentation format for the Framework Core 
does not suggest a specific implementation order or imply a degree of importance of the 
Categories, Subcategories, and Informative References. The Framework Core presented in this 
appendix represents a common set of activities for managing cybersecurity risk. While the 
Framework is not exhaustive, it is extensible, allowing organizations, sectors, and other entities 
to use Subcategories and Informative References that are cost-effective and efficient and that 
enable them to manage their cybersecurity risk. Activities can be selected from the Framework 
Core during the Profile creation process and additional Categories, Subcategories, and 
Informative References may be added to the Profile. An organization’s risk management 
processes, legal/regulatory requirements, business/mission objectives, and organizational 
constraints guide the selection of these activities during Profile creation. Personal information is 
considered a component of data or assets referenced in the Categories when assessing security 
risks and protections. 
While the intended outcomes identified in the Functions, Categories, and Subcategories are the 
same for IT and ICS, the operational environments and considerations for IT and ICS differ. ICS 
have a direct effect on the physical world, including potential risks to the health and safety of 
individuals, and impact on the environment. Additionally, ICS have unique performance and 
reliability requirements compared with IT, and the goals of safety and efficiency must be 
considered when implementing cybersecurity measures. 
For ease of use, each component of the Framework Core is given a unique identifier. Functions 
and Categories each have a unique alphabetic identifier, as shown in Table 1. Subcategories 
within each Category are referenced numerically; the unique identifier for each Subcategory is 
included in Table 2. 
Additional supporting material, including Informative References, relating to the Framework can 
be found on the NIST website at http://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/.

Informative References are only mapped to the control level, though any control enhancement might be found useful in 
achieving a subcategory outcome. 
Mappings between the Framework Core Subcategories and the specified sections in the Informative References are not intended to 
definitively determine whether the specified sections in the Informative References provide the desired Subcategory outcome.  
Informative References are not exhaustive, in that not every element (e.g., control, requirement) of a given Informative Reference is 
mapped to Framework Core Subcategories.

This appendix defines selected terms used in the publication. 
Table 3: Framework Glossary 
Buyer 
The people or organizations that consume a given product or service. 
Category 
The subdivision of a Function into groups of cybersecurity outcomes, 
closely tied to programmatic needs and particular activities. Examples 
of Categories include “Asset Management,” “Identity Management 
and Access Control,” and “Detection Processes.” 
Critical 
Infrastructure 
Systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United 
States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets 
would have a debilitating impact on cybersecurity, national economic 
security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those 
matters. 
Cybersecurity 
The process of protecting information by preventing, detecting, and 
responding to attacks. 
Cybersecurity 
Event 
A cybersecurity change that may have an impact on organizational 
operations (including mission, capabilities, or reputation). 
Cybersecurity 
Incident 
A cybersecurity event that has been determined to have an impact on 
the organization prompting the need for response and recovery. 
Detect (function) 
Develop and implement the appropriate activities to identify the 
occurrence of a cybersecurity event. 
Framework 
A risk-based approach to reducing cybersecurity risk composed of 
three parts: the Framework Core, the Framework Profile, and the 
Framework Implementation Tiers. Also known as the “Cybersecurity 
Framework.” 
Framework Core 
A set of cybersecurity activities and references that are common 
across critical infrastructure sectors and are organized around 
particular outcomes. The Framework Core comprises four types of 
elements: Functions, Categories, Subcategories, and Informative 
References. 
Framework 
Implementation 
Tier 
A lens through which to view the characteristics of an organization’s 
approach to risk—how an organization views cybersecurity risk and 
the processes in place to manage that risk.

Framework 
Profile 
A representation of the outcomes that a particular system or 
organization has selected from the Framework Categories and 
Subcategories. 
Function 
One of the main components of the Framework. Functions provide the 
highest level of structure for organizing basic cybersecurity activities 
into Categories and Subcategories. The five functions are Identify, 
Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. 
Identify (function) 
Develop the organizational understanding to manage cybersecurity 
risk to systems, assets, data, and capabilities. 
Informative 
Reference 
A specific section of standards, guidelines, and practices common 
among critical infrastructure sectors that illustrates a method to 
achieve the outcomes associated with each Subcategory. An example 
of an Informative Reference is ISO/IEC 27001 Control A.10.8.3, 
which supports the “Data-in-transit is protected” Subcategory of the 
“Data Security” Category in the “Protect” function. 
Mobile Code 
A program (e.g., script, macro, or other portable instruction) that can 
be shipped unchanged to a heterogeneous collection of platforms and 
executed with identical semantics. 
Protect (function) 
Develop and implement the appropriate safeguards to ensure delivery 
of critical infrastructure services. 
Privileged User 
A user that is authorized (and, therefore, trusted) to perform security-
relevant functions that ordinary users are not authorized to perform. 
Recover (function) 
Develop and implement the appropriate activities to maintain plans for 
resilience and to restore any capabilities or services that were impaired 
due to a cybersecurity event. 
Respond 
(function) 
Develop and implement the appropriate activities to take action 
regarding a detected cybersecurity event. 
Risk 
A measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential 
circumstance or event, and typically a function of: (i) the adverse 
impacts that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs; and (ii) 
the likelihood of occurrence. 
Risk Management 
The process of identifying, assessing, and responding to risk. 
Subcategory 
The subdivision of a Category into specific outcomes of technical 
and/or management activities. Examples of Subcategories include 
“External information systems are catalogued,” “Data-at-rest is 
protected,” and “Notifications from detection systems are 
investigated.”

Supplier 
Product and service providers used for an organization’s internal 
purposes (e.g., IT infrastructure) or integrated into the products of 
services provided to that organization’s Buyers. 
Taxonomy 
A scheme of classification.
